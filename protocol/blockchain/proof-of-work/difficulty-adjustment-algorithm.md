# Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm

The current Bitcoin Cash difficulty adjustment algorithm attempts to ensure that the difficulty of new blocks is always closely tied to recent block difficulties.
Put into place as a part of [HF-20171113](/protocol/forks/hf-20171113), it operates as follows:

 - ...

## Legacy Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm

Prior to [BCH UAHF](/protocol/forks/bch-uahf), the original Bitcoin difficulty adjustment algorithm was used.
This algorithm operated as follows:

 - ...

## Emergency Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm

As a part of BCH UAHF, due to the anticipated decrease in hashing power, the following adjustment to the legacy difficulty adjustment algorithm above was put into place:

 - ...

This algorithm was superseded by the current difficulty adjustment algorithm as a part of HF-20171113.
